1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
- We compared our runner file to the flashcard runner file. We created a game class for all of the methods we needed to call in the runner. We ran the game file over and over and played many rounds to identify errors and adjusted the game class as necessary.   
2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
- We'd like the computer to make educated guesses after scoring a first 'hit'.
3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
- Communication of schedules, solid distribution of labor, pretty equal amount of time driving vs. copiloting.
4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
- Face to face, we discussed the problems in the code and tried solutions offered by each partner.
